        Building Wordle


Rough outtline of User input 
    - What does the user see of the game? 
        - The user see's two areas of the screen, one is the 5column x 6row output grid that tracks the users current and previous input and displays the games feedback on this input upon clicking enter. 
        -The other 10column x 3 row grid is for user input and is a list of alphabetical keys, a submit(enter) button, and a backspace button

    - How does the user interact with the game?
        - The user clicks and input key of their chosen letter, the letter then appears in the display grid. This continues until 5 letters are input and the user presses enter at which point feedback is returned on the guess. (input must === 5 or submit !work) 
        - 4 input types - letters - submit - clear - refresh/restart game
            -29 buttons - 26 letters, 1 clear, 1 enter - 1 restart - 5 letter cap on input (condition check if array.length<6 allow if else - do nothing/give feedback) - on submit we need to store their input to stay displayed and create a new way to store the next word input
        - The user may clear back through their answer at any point using the clear button (on clear we must remove the last value input and be able to remove all 5 values - array.push on input ? array pop - if pressed and 0 letter left provide feedback to user the button wont work. )

    -What unexpected inputs may there be?
        - >5 letters for a guess
        - number of clears > number of letters input 
        - clicking enter guess before having 5 letters
        - potential pitfall - entering more than one of the same letter - how do we handle this?

        look at later - words not in the english dictionary. 

    -How does the game provide feedback to the user? 
        - Displaying letters input as done - on click - 
        - Displaying previous words submitted at all times - object with 6 empty arrays - on submit updates to next array? or string vs string check and on each button click use a for loop to check if it has input then inputs in the nexT? 
        - Dispalying which words are in the word but not the right place (use array index check - check for right index position and if the array contains it at all)
        - displaying on the keyboard the same feedback as in the display (same function applies the same css class to both output and input).


    -How does the game end?
        -   The game ends when the user guesses the correct words - need to alert this and end all input except restart
        - The user runs out of guess - NEed to restrict and input except restart at this point.

    -How does the user start a new game?
        - We need a restart button that resets all. 


Build the game to check against 1 five letter word first then scale up if succesfull 
- use recap day demo on chekcing a string against a string by converting it to an array and foreaching it.
